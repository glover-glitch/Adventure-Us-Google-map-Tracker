# Adventure-Us-Google-map-Tracker
The code used to display the tracks and current location of Adventure Us on a map.  
The boat uses a signalk plugin to save the sks data to an influxdb 2.0 cloud instance.
Then this code pulls that data and displays on google maps.
This code also pulls in a few data poibts and displays at the current location.

I am not the worlds best programmer, this code is not pretty nor efficient.  It just works.
Feel free to make it better and then share your work.

Hopefully this helps others as a good starting point.
